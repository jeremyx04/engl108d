								<h3>Introduction</h3>
								<p> 
									Take a moment to reflect on what you think when you scroll through social media. For me, one of the first things that comes to mind is the feeling of discontentment. It’s a feeling that sneaks up on me as I subconsciously compare myself to others in various aspects, whether it’s academics, social life, wealth, fitness - you name it, I’ve probably compared it at some point. It's almost as if social media has become a modern-day battleground where we quietly measure ourselves against curated snapshots of others' lives. This silent battle often leaves us with a sense of insecurity that can cloud our thoughts and make it difficult to appreciate our own accomplishments. 
								</p>
								<h3>Background</h3>
								<p>
									Scrolling through social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook has become a daily ritual for many of us. We constantly see posts of people reaching career milestones, celebrating important life events, and enjoying lavish vacations. This leads to 
									<strong>upward comparison</strong> - measuring ourselves against someone seemingly better off - which often results in feelings of inferiority and jealousy. Can you think of anyone who is deeply jealous yet remains genuinely content with their life? Probably not. Needless to say, upward comparison can cause stress and anxiety, taking a major toll on your mental well-being. Then there’s the flip side, when you look at others who are less fortunate and think to yourself: “At least I’m not in their shoes”. This is known as 
									<strong>downward comparison</strong>, and although it can give you a temporary confidence boost, it often creates a false sense of pride that ultimately backfires. Rather than using others' misfortune as an ego boost for ourselves, we should acknowledge their struggles and extend help if at all possible. 
									<a href="https://hai.stanford.edu/news/psychiatrists-perspective-social-media-algorithms-and-mental-health">A study from Stanford </a>
									states that “frequent social comparison can lead to negative effects including erosion of self-esteem, depression, and decreased life satisfaction” (Qiu). Clearly, this terrible habit of comparison has many undesirable effects that you may not even have realized before. Admittedly, I often find myself experiencing both upward and downward comparisons, impacting my mental health for the worse.

								<h3>Hidden Variables</h3>
								<p>
									When we compare ourselves to others, there are often many external variables that we fail to consider. As a simple example, say you applied for a job and got promptly rejected. Soon after, you check LinkedIn and notice that another person who appears to have similar qualifications as you has secured the position. This leaves you with feelings of inferiority, but is this really a fair comparison? There could be numerous reasons for your rejection, many of which may have been completely beyond your control. Perhaps the recruiter reviewing your résumé was simply  having a bad day, or they may even have skipped it altogether. Alternatively, the other candidate’s experiences might have better aligned with the job’s specific requirements. Either way, it is important to recognize that these external factors are often hidden from our view, which can distort our self-perception. In most cases, even if you think that the comparison is fair, it probably is not, and therefore should not be taken that way. With that in mind, a single failure does not define the outcome of your future endeavors. By viewing each setback as a chance to grow rather than an outlook of your shortcomings, you develop a mindset that will ultimately lead to achieving your goals.
								</p>
								<h3>The role of luck</h3>
								<p>
									Moreover, it is undeniable that luck plays a significant role in many peoples’ successes. Of course, it's not to say that successful individuals got to where they are solely through luck, but rather that everyone is born into dramatically different circumstances. Some people have access to resources, networks, and opportunities that others might not. As Randy Pausch famously said, 
									“It's not about the cards you're dealt, but how you play the hand” (Pausch). This perspective teaches us to focus on maximizing our own potential rather than comparing ourselves to others. Personally, I found that playing to my strengths and worrying only about the  things in my control has significantly improved my mental health and confidence. Instead of feeling discouraged by others’ achievements, I’ve learned to draw inspiration from them, creating a positive cycle of motivation and personal growth. 
								</p>
								<blockquote style="font-size: 32px">
									The only comparison that matters is between your present and past self. 
								</blockquote>
								<p>
									A thought I often have with myself is the never ending cycle of comparison by using others’ successes as a benchmark for our own. The pursuit of money/wealth is one such instance - there will always be someone with more money to compare yourself to (unless you become the richest in the world, of course). Realistically, goals like these are not achievable and do not bring long term contentment since there will always be more that can be obtained. These temptations might stray you away from your original path and can take away from the things that truly make you happy. Instead of focusing on our own aspirations, we may become fixated on outdoing others, limiting our potential for genuine fulfillment. Everyone’s definition of success is different, and finding contentment in achieving our own goals will almost certainly lead to a more fulfilling life than chasing the conventional markers like wealth and fame. After all, as long as we are satisfied with our own progress, others’ opinions should <strong>not</strong> have an effect on our mental well-being.
								</p>
								<h3> So comparison is bad, but how can we avoid it? </h3>
								<p>
									It’s easy to get overwhelmed by the constant stream of social media posts bombarding us daily, most of which highlight the best moments of other people's lives. One of the most effective ways to mitigate the negative effects of this is to practice gratitude. Instead of constantly worrying about the things we lack, we should focus on the things we already have. It’s an obvious yet profound truth - grateful people find more happiness in their lives. It doesn’t have to be anything grand either. You can be grateful for just about anything, from that first sip of coffee in the morning, to having a warm bed to sleep in at night, or even just the fact that you are alive and well. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier">An article from Harvard</a> showed that “gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness”, so by incorporating a few simple acts of gratitude into your daily life, you can significantly boost your well-being. We all have our own unique set of talents, faults, and qualities that define who we are, and we should be grateful for that. Keeping a journal can also help. This simple practice has become a part of my daily routine, and it has definitely helped me keep a positive attitude towards my life. Your entries can be brief; for instance, you could simply jot down something you were grateful for each day. Although it may not seem like much, it provides a gentle reminder that even through life’s most difficult challenges, there is always something to be thankful for.
								</p>
								<h3> Final Thoughts </h3>
								<p>
									As social creatures, comparing ourselves to others is a natural thing to do. We are inherently curious about how the people around us are doing and often can't help but measure ourselves against them. However, it is important to remember that life is not all about being better than others. Frequent comparison can prevent us from living our lives to the fullest, and therefore should be avoided in general. I hope that if there is one thing that you can take away from this post, it is as Theodore Roosevelt once said - 
									<strong>comparison truly is the thief of joy</strong>. So, the next time you find yourself caught in the depths of social media, take a step back, practice gratitude, and remember that your journey through life is defined only by yourself.
